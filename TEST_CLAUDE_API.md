## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "Anthropic API key not configured"
- **Solution**: Make sure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is added to Netlify environment variables and redeploy

**Problem**: Search returns error after 30 seconds
- **Solution**: Netlify functions timeout after 10 seconds on free tier. The queries should complete in 2-3 seconds.

**Problem**: API key invalid
- **Solution**: Double-check the API key in Netlify matches the one from Anthropic console

## Next Steps After Testing

Once everything works:
1. Merge this branch to main
2. Use branches for all future features
3. Monitor API costs in Anthropic console
4. Consider adding fiber tracking to nutrition data

## Environment Variable Check

Make sure in Netlify:
- Variable name is exactly: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (all caps, with underscores)
- Value starts with: `sk-ant-api03-`
- Scopes: "All deploys" or "All scopes"
- After adding, you MUST redeploy (or trigger a new deploy)
